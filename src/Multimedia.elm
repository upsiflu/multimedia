- <more summary="Fluid animations and transitions in css \u{00A0} "> I added custom elements where the centralism of the Elm architecture seemed unnecessary. </more> \u{00A0} to match the idea of moving across segments.
-  Automatic <more summary="linking across the segments"> (for example to connect the articles on events with the corresponding facilitator bios) by auto-generating a dictionary with valid links and fuzzy matching of URL paths.</more>
- <more summary="Integrating a Google Drive folder as well as an are.na channel"> Unfortunately, both services have a very limited Api.
